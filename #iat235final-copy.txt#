Introduction

We flush away many things into our sewers as waste. But did you know that your pharmaceutical waste gets dumped into the environment?

The Big Issue with Big Issues

Sometimes issues that involve a lot of people get very complicated. When this happens the problem requires a wide range of expertise across fields. Here we have the process of consuming medication (a human factor), how the sewers filter it (a technological factor), and how it gets into the water supply (an environmental factor), all connecting to one another.

When this happens the experts in each of these parts might have a hard time talking to each other. So itâ€™s good to have ways of communicating that everyone can understand. We have maps that let people get a quick grasp of the issue. Also below there are frequently asked questions.
